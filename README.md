## Author's Notes

#### Preliminary Thoughts

I have some prior experience with Object Oriented concepts from a Java course I took in the past, so that is helpful. Still, this should be a valuable experience as I probably would not naturally use classes as often as I should. For example, the instructions recommend thinking about what should be a class versus an instance variable or method. I immediately considered squares as candidates for being a class, but it was not instantly obvious to me what other data could be represented as a class. Since, I've recognized how beneficial it would be to also represent the players as a class, and how that would make a lot of sense as well.
